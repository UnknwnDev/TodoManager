# What I have in mind for this project
- For this project I want to be able to make a todo list manager
- With this manager I want to later on incorporate it as a skill/module for a AI assistant I want to make in the future called ~~~(REDACTED)~~~
- This Todo Manager will have a gui web interface
- A plan for the future with this project is to store the tasks on my server and create a web interface that runs on the server

Python Version: 3.11+
